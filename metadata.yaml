description: "Jill The Reckless is a novel by P. G. Wodehouse, first published in\
  \ the United States on October 8, 1920 by George H. Doran, New York, (under the\
  \ title The Little Warrior), and in the United Kingdom by Herbert Jenkins, London,\
  \ on 4 July 1921. It was serialised in Collier's (US) between 10 April and 28 August\
  \ 1920, in Maclean's (Canada) between 1 August and 15 November 1920, in both cases\
  \ as The Little Warrior, and, as Jill the Reckless, in the Grand Magazine (UK),\
  \ from September 1920 to June 1921.\nThe heroine here, Jill Mariner, is a sweet-natured\
  \ and wealthy young woman who, at the opening, is engaged to a knighted MP, Sir\
  \ Derek Underhill. We follow her through financial disaster, an adventure with a\
  \ parrot, a policeman and the colourful proletariat, a broken engagement, an awkward\
  \ stay with some grasping relatives, employment as a chorus girl, and of course,\
  \ the finding of true love.\nOther characters include wealthy, dimwitted clubman\
  \ Freddie Rooke (a precursor of Bertie Wooster), ruggedly attractive writer Wally\
  \ Mason, both of these childhood friends of Jill's; her financially inept uncle\
  \ Major Christopher Selby; and Sir Derek's domineering mother, Lady Underhill; Jill's\
  \ unpleasant relatives in Long Island, New York; Elmer, Julia and Tibby Mariner;\
  \ Drones Club member Algy Martyn, various chorus girls, composers and other theatrical\
  \ types, and, of course, miscellaneous servants.\nGeorge Bevan, composer hero of\
  \ Wodehouse's previous work A Damsel in Distress, receives a passing mention, as\
  \ does an unspecified member of the Threepwood family.\nThe dust jacket of the UK\
  \ first edition published by Herbert Jenkins was designed by Edmund Blampied.\n\
